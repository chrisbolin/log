Amazon doesn't include much detail in their email receipts. No product name or product link. Just an order ID and link to the _specific order_ (not a link to the product). I am guessing they do this to work around Gmail's spying. Google reads ever email for advertizing, and they could read for mild corporate espionage. I am guessing that over half of Amazon's US customers use Gmail, too, so it's a significant threat.
