Amazon doesn't include much detail in their email receipts. No product name or product link. Just an order ID and link to the _specific_ order (not product). My guess for their rationale: Gmail. Google reads ever email for advertizing, and they could read for mild corporate espionage. I am guessing that over half of Amazon's US customer's use Gmail, too.
