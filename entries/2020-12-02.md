### The Pit of Incredulity

One of the greatest barriers to my understanding seems to be my own incredulity. I remain ignorant of ideas and concepts simply because I am initially utterly flabbergasted by them. "I can't believe it's that complicated." "How could that be necessary?" "There is no way anyone would do that."

One way to climb out of this "pit of incredulity" is to eschew emotional reasoning. Try and take the perspective of a dispassionate third party.

I also try to remind myself of a very simple truth: things are this way—as dumbfounding as it may be—for some reason. Believe there is a reason, and seek it out.
