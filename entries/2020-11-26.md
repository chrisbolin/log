This is the most powerful description of privacy I've come across:

> Privacy is more than an instrument to advance liberty or check control. It is a buffer for self-development free from the influence of society and culture. It enables all the factors we need to develop distinct identities: autonomy, free thought, creativity, experimentation, and exploration. And through this same buffer, we are afforded the resources to discover the type of society we want to be a part of and the steps we need to take to get there. These are decisions we need to make while we still have the agency to do so.

This excerpt is from ["Your Digital Fingerprint"](https://thedisconnect.co/two/your-digital-fingerprint) by Nick Briz and Clayton D'Arnault. The original idea comes from Georgetown University law professor Julie E. Cohen; her paper ["What Privacy Is For"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2175406) explores the topic in more detail.
