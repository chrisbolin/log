I remain ignorant of ideas and concepts simply because I am initially utterly flabbergasted by them. “I can’t believe it’s that complicated.” “How could that be necessary?” “There is no way anyone would do that.”</p>\n<p>One way to climb out of this “pit of incredulity” is to eschew emotional reasoning. Try and take the perspective of a dispassionate third party.</p>\n<p>I also try to remind myself of a very simple truth: things are this way—as dumbfounding as it may be—for some reason. Believe there is a reason, and seek it out.</p>\n","timestamp":"2020-12-02T12:00:00.000Z","slug":"2020-12-02"},{"html":"<p>The hardest and most frequent problems are miscommunications.</p>\n","timestamp":"2020-12-01T12:00:00.000Z","slug":"2020-12-01"},{"html":"<p>This is the most powerful description of privacy I’ve come across:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Privacy is more than an instrument to advance liberty or check control. It is a buffer for self-development free from the influence of society and culture. It enables all the factors we need to develop distinct identities: autonomy, free thought, creativity, experimentation, and exploration. And through this same buffer, we are afforded the resources to discover the type of society we want to be a part of and the steps we need to take to get there. These are decisions we need to make while we still have the agency to do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This excerpt is from <a href=\"https://thedisconnect.co/two/your-digital-fingerprint\">“Your Digital Fingerprint”</a> by Nick Briz and Clayton D’Arnault.

Depending on your definition, either almost everything in modern society is unnatural or it is natural.</p>\n<p>If the definition of natural is “that which would be expected in a prehistoric environment,” then our medicine and agriculture and books (not to mention our internal combustion engines and microprocessors and petabyte databases) are all unnatural. Even written language could feasibly be labeled unnatural, as it is a relatively recent innovation.</p>\n<p>Conversely, if the definition of natural is “that which is not supernatural,” then everything in this world is natural.</p>\n<p>Most arguments based on what is “natural” are actually arguments based on what the speaker believes is right and normal.

About a half decade ago I listened to some of <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_your_elusive_creative_genius\">her talks</a> and then read <a href=\"https://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/big-magic/\"><em>Big Magic</em></a>.</p>\n<p>The most influential takeaway for me: <em>Don’t try to find your passion; instead, follow your creativity.</em> From <em>Big Magic</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe that curiosity is the secret. Curiosity is the truth and the way of creative living. Curiosity is the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end. Furthermore, curiosity is accessible to everyone. Passion can seem intimidatingly out of reach at times—a distant tower of flame, accessible only to geniuses and to those who are specially touched by God. But curiosity is a milder, quieter, more welcoming, and more democratic entity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","timestamp":"2020-11-24T12:00:00.000Z","slug":"2020-11-24-B"},{"html":"\n<p>Two ideas.

The float and flutter of the flakes. Particles that seem to rise with innate antigravity against the fall of their compatriots. I am sure countless mathematical descriptions of the process have been made, but adding one more to the list would at least be personally interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>Automated coin flipping experiment.</strong> This might sound crazy at first (and maybe at last, too), but I want to build an physical automated coin flipper, complete with side detection (probably machine vision) and automatic re-flipping. It would be fun to see the law of large numbers unfold. What is the true bias of specific coins? What is the largest number of coin flips on a single coin?
